# Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project, I implemented a Controller of famous game
Tic Tac Toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) for two
players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a n√ón grid. The
player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
